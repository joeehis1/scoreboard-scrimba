SCRIMBA SOLO PROJECT

This is the completed project for the first part of the making websites interactive module. It is done using pure vanilla js. The styling was done with sass. Sass source files not included in this project. I'm using these projects as a good opportunity to apply what I learn and what I'm currently learning, and if possible gain some new knowledge along the way.
